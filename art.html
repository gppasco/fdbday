    <i>I like to take a day to appreciate art — heck, I'll take a whole 31! Good thing I have these comfy foam clogs on this beautiful fall month.</i><br><br><br>

    Four days into the month, I saw a dog. I looked at the lower of the spots between its eyes, and noted what I found there. Then I looked two spots above the middle of its collar, and noted what I found there. <br><br>
Two days later, I saw a person holding a torch. I looked directly above the middle of the person's head, and noted what I found there. Then, I noticed that for both parts of the rightmost tongue of the torch's flame (the tongue shooting in a northeastern direction), I saw the same thing directly to the right. I noted what I found there (just the once). <br><br>
Two days later, I saw a vial of... something. I looked two spots below the middle of the vial's top border, and noted what I found there. Then, I looked at the top right corner of the vial, and noted what I found there. <br><br>
Thirteen days later, I was delighted to see a colorful reminder of my childhood. I looked at the top right corner of everything I could see, and noted what I found there. In the lower right, I saw a purple and a blue piece. Between them was one thing, which I halved (visually), and noted one of the halves. <br><br>
Three days later, my feet ached. Thankfully, I saw a beautiful boot. I looked at the very bottom tip of the toe, went two spots northwest, and noted what I found there. Then, I looked at the bottom left corner of the heel, and noted what I found there. <br><br>
One week later, I found myself in a blank expanse. I looked directly above the center of the expanse, and noted what I found there. Then, I looked directly to the right of what I just noted, and noted what I found there. <br><br>
